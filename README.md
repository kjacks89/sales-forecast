# sales-forecast
The purpose of this project was to determine the weekly sales forecast for a restaurant chain.  It used an ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model to perform time series analysis based upon the previous 4 years of weekly sales.  The model was trained using a large data set (over 1.5 million rows from several CSV files).
